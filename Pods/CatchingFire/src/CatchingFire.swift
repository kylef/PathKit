/// This allows you to write safe tests for the happy path of failable functions.
/// It helps you to avoid the `try!` operator in tests.
///
/// If you want to test a function, which may fail in general, you may think of using `try`.
/// But this would mean that you have to declare your test method as throwing, which causes that
/// XCTest doesn't execute the test anymore.
///
/// So in consequence, you would usually need to write:
///
///     XCTAssertEqual(try! fib(x), 21)
///
/// If the expression fails, your whole test suite doesn't execute further and aborts immediately,
/// which is very undesirable, especially on CI, but also for your workflow when you use TDD.
///
/// Instead you can write now:
///
///     AssertNoThrow {
///         XCTAssertEqual(try fib(x), 21)
///     }
///
/// Or alternatively:
///
///     AssertNoThrow(try fib(x)).map { (y: Int) in
///         XCTAssertEqual(y, 21)
///     }
///
/// If the expression fails, your test fails.
